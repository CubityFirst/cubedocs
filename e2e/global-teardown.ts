// Tests that fail mid-flow leave dormant rows behind: a user the spec couldn't
// log back into for cleanup, a project whose owner-delete never ran, etc.
// Each spec's afterAll already does a best-effort cleanup, but it can't run
// when the dev stack is broken or the page is in a weird state.
//
// This hook is the safety net: after every spec finishes, wipe any row that
// was clearly created by the e2e suite. It runs as a Node process (no Page),
// so we shell out to wrangler. It also runs on Playwright failure exits.
//
// FK cascades handle most of the auth-DB tail (sessions, webauthn, backup
// codes, moderation events). email_verification_tokens has no cascade, so we
// delete it explicitly first. On the API DB, deleting projects cascades
// everything below (docs, folders, files, members, invite links).
