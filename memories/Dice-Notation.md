| `2d8r1r3r5r7` | Roll 2d8, reroll any odd result (multiple conditions) |
| `2d10ro<2` | Roll 2d10, reroll once if less than 2 |
| `1dF` / `4dF` | Fate/Fudge dice (results: -1, 0, +1) |
| `1d[fire,ice]` | Table roll (random string entry) |
| `1d[2,4,6,8]` | Pool roll (custom numeric faces) |
| `2d6+1d4+3` | Compound expressions with `+` `-` `*` `/` |
| `2d6%4` | Modulus: remainder of division |
| `2d6**2` | Exponentiation (right-associative) |
| `floor(2d6/3)` | Math functions: `floor`, `ceil`, `round`, `abs` |
| `(2d6+1d4)*2` | Parentheses for grouping |
| `2d6[Fire] +1d4[Cold]` | Inline labels per term |
| `2d6 Roll for Initiative` | Overall roll label (space-separated) |
| `2d6 \| Roll for Initiative` | Overall roll label (explicit `\` separator) |
| `1d20cs>10` | Critical success on > 10 (amber die highlight + "CRIT!" badge) |
| `1d20cf<3` | Critical failure/fumble on < 3 (purple die highlight + "FUMBLE!" badge) |
| `1d20cs20cs10` | Critical success on exactly 20 or 10 (multiple exact values) |
| `1d20cs>18cf<3` | Combined cs and cf conditions on one die |
| `{4d6+3d8}kh1` | Group roll — keep highest single die across all dice in the group |
| `{4d6,3d8}kh1` | Group roll (comma) — sum each sub-expression, keep highest group total |
| `{4d6+3d8}d2` | Group drop — drop the 2 lowest dice across the sub-expression |
| `{4d6,2d8,3d20}d1` | Group drop (comma) — drop sub-expression with lowest total, sum the rest |
| `{4d6,2d8,3d20}dh1` | Group drop highest — drop sub-expression with highest total |
| `3d6!` | Exploding dice — reroll and add on max face; chain continues while max is rolled |
| `3d6!>4` | Exploding on any result > 4 |
| `3d6!3` | Exploding only on exactly 3 |
| `5d6!!` | Compound exploding (Shadowrun) — extra rolls accumulate into one value per die |
| `5d6!p` | Penetrating exploding (HackMaster) — each extra roll has −1 applied |
| `3d6>3` | Success counting — count dice that rolled > 3 |
| `10d6<4` | Success counting — count dice that rolled < 4 |
| `3d6>3f1` | Failure count — count successes (>3) minus failures (=1) |
| `10d6<4f>5` | Failure count — count successes (<4) minus failures (>5) |
| `{5d6!!}>8` | Group success count — compound exploding, count dice with total > 8 |
| `{3d6+1}<3` | Group success count with modifier per die |
| `{3d20+5}>21f<10` | Group failure count — success >21 minus failure <10 |
| `1d20+13>21` | Expression success — roll 1d20+13, show ✓/✗ vs target 21 |
| `(2+3)d6` | Computed dice count — roll `round(2+3)` d6 dice |
| `2d(3+3)` | Computed dice sides — roll 2 dice with `round(3+3)` sides each |
| `(N+Y)d(X+Z)` | Both count and sides may be computed expressions |
| `2d6m` | Match-show — sum unchanged; pairs (2+ same value) flagged in result |
| `2d6mt` | Match-tally — total = number of distinct face values appearing 2+ times |
| `6d6mt3` | mt with minimum match group size of 3 |
| `5d6mt3>4` | mt requiring 3+ matches AND matched value > 4 |

Reroll conditions can be chained and combined with keep: `4d6kh3r1` rolls 4d6, rerolls 1s, then keeps the highest 3.

Critical success (`cs`) and critical failure (`cf`) conditions only affect display — they color individual dice amber/purple and show a CRIT!/FUMBLE! badge, but do not alter roll mechanics.

Operator precedence (high to low): parentheses → `floor`/`ceil`/`round`/`abs` → `**` → `*` `/` `%` → `+` `-`. Division produces a float; use `floor()` to truncate.
