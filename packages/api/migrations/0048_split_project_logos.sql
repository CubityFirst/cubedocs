-- Split per-project logo into two slots: a square icon (used in the projects
-- sidebar, favourites, profile cards) and a wide wordmark (used in the
-- top-left of published-site headers). Existing single-slot uploads are
-- migrated into logo_wide_updated_at (most users uploaded wordmark-style
-- assets that fit the published-site header); the square slot starts empty
-- and admins re-upload a square icon when they want one.
--
-- R2 keys move from `site-logos/{id}` to `site-logos/{id}-square` /
-- `site-logos/{id}-wide` — handled out-of-band by
-- packages/api/scripts/backfill-logo-keys.ts.
