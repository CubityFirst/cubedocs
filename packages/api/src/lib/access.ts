// ── The single per-site access-check boundary ───────────────────────────────
//
// Every authenticated per-site authorization gate resolves a caller's EFFECTIVE
// role here, instead of querying project_members directly. The effective role
// is the higher-ranked (by ROLE_RANK) of:
//   (a) the caller's direct, accepted project_members row, and
//   (b) the caller's accepted organization_members role for the site's
//       organization_id (org membership trickles down to every site in the org).
//
// Org roles never include 'limited' (a per-doc-share concept with no org
// meaning), so a direct-'limited' member who is ALSO an org viewer+ is correctly
// elevated out of the per-doc-share gate — exactly the intended trickle-down.
//
// Resolved at read time (NOT materialized into project_members rows): one
// source of truth, no fan-out writes on membership/attach changes, and
// project_members row semantics (favourite/hidden/accepted/invited_by, the
// members list, doc_shares) stay meaning "directly invited here".
//
// DO NOT re-introduce a local getCallerRole / inline project_members role query
// for a caller-access gate. Direct project_members queries remain ONLY for:
// target-row escalation guards (members/docShares), attribution joins
// (author_id/uploaded_by), the GET /projects "Your Sites" list, the site
// members-list CONTENTS, and attach's site-owner check (which must be direct,
// not effective — see routes/organizations.ts).
