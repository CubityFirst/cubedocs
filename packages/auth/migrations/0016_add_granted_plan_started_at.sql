-- Tracks when a manual grant was applied. Lets the resolver surface a
-- "Supporter since X" date for gifted users the same way personal_plan_started_at
-- does for paid users. Backfills existing grants to "now" since we have no
-- prior timestamp — admins can correct individual rows manually if needed.
