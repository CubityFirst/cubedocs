                By creating an account or using Annex, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you

              <p>
                You retain ownership of all content you create in Annex. By using the service, you

              </p>
              <p>
                You are solely responsible for the content you upload or publish. We do not

              </p>

              <h2>5. Service Availability</h2>
              <p>
                We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The
                service is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We may modify, suspend,
                or discontinue any part of the service at any time with reasonable notice where
                possible.
              </p>

              <h2>6. Payments and Refunds</h2>
              <p>
                Paid plans are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis. All fees are
                non-refundable except where required by law. You may cancel your subscription at
                any time; access continues until the end of the current billing period.

              <h2>7. Termination</h2>
              <p>
                You may stop using Annex and delete your account at any time. We may suspend or
                terminate your account for violations of these terms. Upon termination, your right
                to use the service ceases immediately.
              </p>

              <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
              <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, Annex and its operators are not liable for
                any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use
                of the service. Our total liability for any claim shall not exceed the amount you
                paid us in the three months preceding the claim.
              </p>

              <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
              <p>
                These terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the operator is
                established, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
